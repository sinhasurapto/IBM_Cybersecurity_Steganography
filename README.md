# IBM_Cybersecurity_Steganography
Steganography is the process of hiding secret data within a non-secret data such as images.

Steganography can help in addressing the following challenges:
* Security: Ensuring the hidden data is protected from unauthorized access and detection.
* Capacity: Maximizing the amount of data that can be hidden without compromising the quality of the carrier image.
* Robustness: Making the system resistant to common steganalysis techniques and image manipulations (e.g., compression, cropping, or noise).
* Visual Quality: Maintaining the perceptual quality of the carrier image to avoid raising suspicion.

Platform required:
* Python: Programming language to write code.
* Visual Studio Code: Environment to develop the project.

Libraries used:
* OpenCV: Used in image processing.
* OS: To configure file paths.
* Tkinter: Used in adding a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
